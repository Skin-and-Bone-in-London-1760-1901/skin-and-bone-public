Tokens	Regularised	Category	Subjects	
The text to be recognised in the description. Each word or item of punctuation is a "token". Each token must be placed in quotes and separated by a comma. Square brackets must be placed around the finished expression. 	An optional, arbitrary string to denote equivalent terms. For example, there are lots of ways to write "marks of flogging". By giving all of these terms the same regularised form ("marks of flogging"), they are treated as interchangeable in the program code. At present, this column is not used. Even if it used in the future, it is optional. Please leave it blank unless you want to denote that several terms represent different ways of writing the same thing.	A category denoting the role which this term plays in the description. For example, "body specifier", "design" or "written words". Please see the second sheet for explanations of these categories.	A list of subjects which are considered relevant to this term. Used only for tattoo-related categories. For example, "love" or "nationalidentity". Subjects are always single words, run together if neccessary. Separate them with a space. For example "religion justicepunishment"
